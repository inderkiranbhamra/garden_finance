# Deploy cert-manager and ExternalDNS with Garden

Creating and managing DNS records and TLS certificates can be expensive for engineering teams.

This example uses cert-manager, a popular Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.

Additionally, to enable dynamic DNS provisioning, ExternalDNS is a great tool that allows for automatic registration of Kubernetes services and ingress objects into a Cloudflare DNS zone.

Both tools combined can improve the automation and reliability of the infrastructure.

## About

This project deploys a small React service in a Kubernetes Cluster and exposes it to an Nginx ingress with HTTPs by using the following Kubernetes Operators:

| service       |   version  |
|---------------|------------|
| cert-manager  |  v1.11.0   |
| external-dns  |   v6.13.3  |

In this example, we are utilizing the brand new actions introduced in Garden Bonsai, providing automation and security to the process.

## Requirements

- A Kubernetes cluster with the correct Security Groups/Firewall rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS.
- A domain name you own, for example, example.com.
- An account in Cloudflare with at least one DNS-hosted zone.
  - You will also need a Cloudflare API Token with the permissions defined in this example.
  - üö® Make sure to use an API Token, not an API Key (or Global Key). This example uses a Cloudflare API Token specifically.
- To have brief prior knowledge of cert-manager and ExternalDNS.
- A Docker Registry (Docker Hub, etc.) and a Kubernetes secret with the credentials of the registry.

## Instructions

To run this project, export the following variable in your ENV.

````bash
export CF_API_TOKEN=your-cf-API-token
````

Then set the required variables in your [project.garden.yml](./project.garden.yml), use the following block as an example for the variables:

````bash
variables:
  # Variables for Docker Registry
  registryHostname: docker.io
  registryNamespace: your-username-namespace
  # Variables for Kubernetes
  DEFAULT_NAMESPACE: default
  # Cert-Manager variables
  CERT_MANAGER_INSTALL_CRDS: true
  GENERATE_PROD_CERTS: false
  GENERATE_STG_CERTS: false
  # External-DNS variables
  CF_DNS_PROVIDER: cloudflare
  CF_DOMAIN: [ your-dns-zone.com ]
  CF_UPDATE_STRATEGY: sync
  CF_EMAIL: your-email@something.com
  CF_PROXIED: false
````

Also, set your Kubernetes context.

````bash
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config current-context # Copy the name of the context
````

After getting your context name, change the `context` field in your [project.garden.yml](./project.garden.yml) file.

For the `deploymentRegistry` and `imagePullSecrets` fields, you must have a Docker Registry (prerequisite #5).

If you already have a Docker registry on Docker Hub or Quay, create a secret with your credentials using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-username=user \
  --docker-password=password \
  --docker-email=docker-email@email.com \
  --docker-server=your-docker-server-url
```

Note: *If you are using Docker Hub*, `--docker-server` should be: `https://index.docker.io/v1/`

Or, you can also follow this awesome guide from the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). Make sure to name your secret `regcred` and keep it in the `default` namespace.

If you decide to set up the secret with a different name make sure to update it in the `imagePullSecrets` configuration.

After setting these values, deploy the configuration for the first time.

````bash
garden deploy --yes
Deploy üöÄ

Done! ‚úîÔ∏è

After the deployment, Garden deploys a fancy landing page without a certificateüéâ.

![First successful deployment](./images/firs-successful-deployment.png)

To generate the certificates, switch `GENERATE_STG_CERTS` from false to true. This action allows Garden to deploy the certificates.

‚ö†Ô∏è As a recommendation, use `Letsencrypt staging` certificates for experimenting with this example; API limits and quotas from production Let's Encrypt are lower and not intended to generate excessive amounts of certificates in a short span [Additional information](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/).

Deploy again to generate the staging certificates with `garden deploy --yes`.

````bash
kubectl get cert
NAME           READY   SECRET         AGE
staging-cert   True    staging-cert   4m23s
````

The staging certificate got created, now uncomment the `tlsCertificates` block in your [project.garden.yml](./project.garden.yml) file.

````yaml
...
kaniko:
  namespace: null
tlsCertificates: # <------ Uncomment this block
  - name: staging-cert
    secretRef:
      name: staging-cert
...
````

Deploy and refresh your browser.

A message stating "your connection is not private" means that certificate got exposed to the NGINX ingress. Browsers do not trust staging certificates, hence the alert.

![Your connection is not private](./images/your-connection-is-not-private.png)

To generate the production certificates, turn `GENERATE_PROD_CERTS` to true and re-deploy the example, waiting for the new certificate to be ready.

````bash
kubectl get cert
NAME              READY   SECRET            AGE
production-cert   True    production-cert   116s
staging-cert      True    staging-cert      24m
````

After generating the production certificate, update the tlsCertificates to reference it, then perform a deployment.

````yaml
tlsCertificates:
  - name: production-cert
    secretRef:
      name: production-cert
````

And voil√†! We can now see the desired üîíÔ∏è on our website. If you've made it this far, the NGINX ingress controller is correctly utilizing your certificate, and we have a valid HTTPS endpoint using the Production certificate üï∫.
