# 6. Next Steps

And that's a wrap!

With the example project all set, you can start thinking about your own project. The steps will be similar, and some work you won't need to repeat.

Garden is a powerful and flexible tool, and there are several things to learn along the way. We recommend the following to get going:

1. Place the project configuration you created for the example, which will already be configured to connect to your cluster, in
   your own project root.
2. Go through the [Using Garden](../../using-garden/README.md) documentation section. This will cover all the key
   concepts, and introduce all the moving parts, including the different action kinds and types that Garden supports.
3. Check out the [Adopting Garden](../../overview/adopting-garden.md) to learn how teams typically adopt Garden.
4. Have a look at the [examples](../../../examples) folder in the Garden repository, which offers several usage examples
   that you can refer to while building out your project.
5. Configure _your_ actions, get them building and deploying.
6. Add more environments. Garden works great in CI and in fact that's often the starting point for many teams. Take a look at our [guide on environments and namespaces](../../guides/namespaces.md) to learn more.

In summary, **gradually put all the pieces together**, learn the details as you go, and use more and more features as you get comfortable.

For a large, complex project, it might be good to start with a subset of it, so that you can start getting value out of Garden quickly.

Whatever your setup is, we're sure you'll be rewarded with an elegant, productive setup for testing and developing your system!

And if there's something you can't find in our docs, we happily encourage you to [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/FrmhuUjFs6) and/or file an issue on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/garden-io/garden). We're more than happy to help!
